# Master Reference

This is the reference I've written for anyone to be able to come and quickly look up how to do things with a few guides here and there.
If you find something useful, star this repo and I'll continue adding to it. If there's an explanation that you think can be explained better, or it doesn't quite make sense to you, please let me know and I'll add more to it!
