nstalling PostgreSQL  ## Linux Ubuntu The following line is meant for Ubuntu version 16.04 (xenial-xerus). If you are on Ubuntu version 18, replace the word "xenial" with "bionic" `$ sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"`  This is for Ubuntu 18 `$ sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ bionic-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"`  Once you have one of the above commands -- as in _not_ both commands, you will continue on running the following commands: ``` $ wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add - $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install postgresql-common $ sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 libpq-dev ```  Once the installation is complete, you'll need to create a user for PostgreSQL. Like so: Replace (username) with your chosen username. Please don't try to type in a literal "(username)" as your username. `$ sudo -u postgres createuser (username) -s`  Now that you have a user for Postgres, you might want to set a password for your account (you do) `sudo -u postgres psql`  The above command drops you into the postgres prompt, it is now waiting for postgres commands, not bash/terminal commands. To set a password for the user account you just created, run the following command: `postgres=# \password (the username you used above)`
